# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal Go project (`github.com/savisec/hello-go`) using Go.

## Ignore Files

Do not read these at all, they will confuse you:
* `private/` â€” Uncommitted scratch files.

## Development Commands

Rely on just commands. See the output of `just --list` is in the file `.claude/just-commands.txt`.
